# Deploying a Java EE Application on Azure Using a Single WebLogic Virtual Machine Instance
This demo shows how you can deploy a Java EE application to Azure using a simple instance of WebLogic Server deployed from the Azure Marketplace.

## Setup

* Install the latest version of Oracle JDK 8 (we used [8u231](https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html)).
* Install the Eclipse IDE for Enterprise Java Developers from [here](https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/packages/).
* Install WebLogic 12.2.1.3 using the Quick Installer by downloading it from [here](https://www.oracle.com/middleware/technologies/weblogic-server-downloads.html).  You need this locally even if you are not running WebLogic locally because the Eclipse WebLogic deployment support needs it.
* Download this repository somewhere in your file system (easiest way might be to download as a zip and extract).
* You will need an Azure subscription. If you don't have one, you can get one for free for one year [here](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/free).

## Create the WebLogic Instance on Azure
The next step is to get WebLogic up and running on a virtual machine. Follow the steps below to do so.
* Go to the [Azure portal](http://portal.azure.com).
* Click 'Create a resource'. In the search box, enter 'weblogic' and press enter. 
* Select 'Oracle WebLogic Server 12.2.1.3 With Admin Server'. Hit 'Create'.
* In the the basics blade, just accept the defaults. 
* The steps in this section use `<your suffix>`. The suffix could be your first name such as "reza". It should be short and reasonably unique.
* Create and specify a new resource group named weblogic-cafe-group-`<your suffix>` . Hit OK. 
* Choose the default for the virtual machine size and hit OK. 
* In the "Credentials for Server Creation" use these values
   * For the "admin account of VMs", enter 'Secret123456'. 
   * Enter your OTN/Oracle.com username and password (you can create an account for free). 
   * For the "Password for WebLogic Administrator", enter 'Secret123456'. 
   * Click OK. 
   * On the Summary blade you must see "Validation passed".  If you don't see this, you must troubleshoot and resolve the reason.  After you have done so, you can continue.
   * On the Summary blade, click OK. On the final screen, click Create.
* It will take some time for the WebLogic configuration to properly deploy (could be up to an hour). Once the deployment completes, in the portal go to 'All resources'.
* Find and click on adminServerVM. Copy the DNS name for the virtual machine. You should be able to log onto http://`<admin server DNS name>`:7001/console successfully using the credentials above.  If you are not able to log in, you must troubleshoot and resolve the reason why before continuing.

## Start Managed PostgreSQL on Azure
We will be using the fully managed PostgreSQL offering in Azure for this demo. Below is how we set it up. 

* Go to the [Azure portal](http://portal.azure.com).
* Select Create a resource -> Databases -> Azure Database for PostgreSQL.  In "How do you plan to use the service?" select "single server".
* In "Resource group" select weblogic-cafe-group-`<your suffix>`
* Specify the Server name to be weblogic-cafe-db-`<your suffix>`.
* Specify the Admin username to be postgres. 
* Specify the Password to be Secret123!. 
* Specify the location to be a location close to you.
* Leave the Version at its default.
* In Compute + Storage click "Configure Server" then choose Basic.
   * Set vCore to the minimum.
   * Set Storage to the minimum.
   * Click 'OK'
* Hit 'Review+create' then 'Create'. It will take a moment for the database to deploy and be ready for use.
* In the portal, go to 'All resources'. Enter `<your suffix>` into the filter box and press enter.
* Find and click on weblogic-cafe-db-`<your suffix>`. 
* Under Settings, open the connection security panel.
   * Toggle "Allow access to Azure services" to "on"
   * Toggle "Disable SSL connection enforcement" to "off". 
   * Hit Save.

## Connect WebLogic to the PostgreSQL Server

* Log in to the WebLogic console at http://`<admin server DNS name>`:7001/console.
* Click on 'Lock and Edit'. 
   * Click on Services -> Data Sources. Select New -> Generic Data Source. 
   * Enter the name as 'WebLogicCafeDB', JNDI name as 'jdbc/WebLogicCafeDB' and select the database type to be PostgreSQL. Click next. 
   * Accept the defaults and click next.  Do not click Finish, even though you could do so.
   * On the next screen select 'Logging Last Resource' and click next. 
   * Enter the database name to be 'postgres'. 
   * Enter the host name as 'weblogic-cafe-db-`<your suffix>`.postgres.database.azure.com'.
   * Leave the port unchanged.
   * Enter the user name as 'postgres@weblogic-cafe-db-`<your suffix>`'. 
   * Enter the password as 'Secret123!'. Click next. 
   * On the next screen, accept the defaults and click next. 
   * On the "Select Targets" screen, select AdminServer, admin, or cluster1 and click Finish.  
   * Click "Activate Changes" at this point.
   * Test the connection.   
      * In the "Data Sources" pane, click "WebLogicCafeDB".
      * Click Monitoring -> Testing
      * Select AdminServer, admin, or any of the nodes in the cluster and click "Test Data Source".  You must see "Test of WebLogicCafeDB on server AdminServer was successful." at the top of this pane after clicking the button.  If you do not, put this workshop aside, troubleshoot and resolve the issue.  Once the connection successfully tests, you may continue.

## Setting Up WebLogic in Eclipse
The next step is to get the application up and running. 

* Start Eclipse.
* If you have not yet installed the Oracle WebLogic Server Tools, do so now.
   * Go to the 'Servers' panel, secondary click. Select New -> Server
   * Select Oracle -> Oracle WebLogic Server Tools. Click next. Accept the license agreement, click 'Finish'.  Eclipse may ask to be restarted.  If so, comply with the request.
* You will now connect Eclipse to your remote WebLogic server.
* Go to the 'Servers' panel, secondary click. Select New -> Server -> Oracle -> Oracle WebLogic Server.
* Choose remote, for the remote host enter `<admin server DNS name>`
* Enter the WebLogic admin username/password from above.
* Click "Test connection".  If "Test connection succeeded!" appears, click Ok and you may continue.  Otherwise, troubleshoot and resolve the reason for the connection failure.
* 'Finish'.

### Open weblogic-cafe in the IDE
* Get the weblogic-cafe application into the IDE. In order to do that, go to File -> Import -> Maven -> Existing Maven Projects.  Click Next
* Then browse to where you have this repository code in your file system and select javaee/weblogic-cafe and click "Open".  
* Accept the rest of the defaults and click "finish".
* Once the application loads, you should do a full Maven build by going to the application and secondary clicking -> Run As -> Maven install.
   * You must see `BUILD SUCCESS` in the Eclipse console in order to proceed.  If you do not, troubleshoot the build problem and resolve it.  Once the application has successfully built, you may continue.

### Deploying the Application
Ensure that the deployment action from Eclipse will target the WebLogic Server running on Azure.
* Secondary click on the weblogic-cafe in the Project Explorer and choose Properties.
* Click on Server in the left navigation pane.
* You should see your local and remote WebLogic servers.  Select the remote one and choose Apply and Close.
* Secondary click on weblogic-cafe in the Prjoect Explorer and choose Run As -> Run on Server.
* Once the application runs, Eclise will open it up in a browser. The application is available at http://`<admin server DNS name>`:7001/weblogic-cafe.

## Exploring the Application

## Cleaning Up

Once you are done exploring all aspects of the demo, you should delete the weblogic-cafe-group-`<your suffix>` resource group. You can do this by going to the portal, going to resource groups, finding and clicking on weblogic-cafe-group-`<your suffix>` and hitting delete. This is especially important if you are not using a free subscription! If you do keep these resources around (for example to begin your own prototype), you should in the least use your own passwords and make the corresponding changes in the demo code.
